--Prior to implementing the code to perform the transpose of a matrix, there was already a memory leak with given code--


--Makefiles are not named as per convention and therefore require different syntax--

for compiling the static version: 
'make -f makefile1'

for compiling the dynamic version:

'make -f makefile2'

after running the executable the following syntax is required to remove the objects (.o) from directory:

'make -f makefile1 clean'

same goes for using makefile 2
